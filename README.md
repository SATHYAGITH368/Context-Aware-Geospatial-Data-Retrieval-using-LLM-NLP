Context-Aware Geospatial Data Retrieval using LLM/NLP

The project aims to develop a context-aware Large Language Model (LLM) system capable of understanding and retrieving geospatial data based on the context provided in user queries. This system will infer implicit information and deliver relevant geospatial data, enhancing the precision and usability of geospatial data retrieval.
Solution Summary:
1. Introduces a new approach for utilizing LLMs in geospatial applications by enabling the model to retain information about spatial objects within an urban area, facilitating its ability to respond to conversational queries about these locations.
2. Straightforward yet effective framework for integrating geospatial knowledge into a pre-trained LLM, encompassing information about Points of Interest (POIs) and their locations, as well as spatial (proximity) awareness within a specific urban area.
 
  ## Detailed solution and Approach (250-300 words)
3. Provide simplified User Interface for GIS-domain experts to assess the output
4. Centralized Feature repository to store and manage feature data from multiple sources, ensuring consistency and reusability
5. Guardrails for our Large Language Models (LLMs) solution helps us in preventing harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content
Search capabilities offered:
1. Name Search: Name Search focus on Name (could be city, country etc name) and
locate point of interest
2. Category Search: Category Search helps in finding near by Category (could be near by hospital in a location) and locate point of interest
3. Type Search: Tell me highly rated places in input Point of interest
